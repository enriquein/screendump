screendump
==========

Saves screenshots in a variety of formats straight into your hard drive. 
This app is written in MFC/C++ and has solution files for Visual Studio
2008. This was my pet project for some time, but now I would just rather
maintain and add features to Cropper, which is written in .Net.

Feel free to fork if you're a masochist.
