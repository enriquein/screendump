screendump
==========

screendump is a light screenshot taking application for Windows written in Visual C++ (MFC). It's main purpose is to make the task of taking a screenshot and saving it to disk a one step process. It has support for saving as JPG, PNG, and BMP, and supports capturing individual windows. 
 
This app is written in MFC/Visual C++ and has solution files for Visual Studio
2008. This was my pet project for some time, but now I would just rather
maintain and add features to Cropper, which is written in C#/.Net.

There's an installer included here for your convenience.
