    AutoCapture lets you set a time interval in which to automatically take a screenshot. 
    This is definitely not something you would use every day, but it comes really handy in some
    situations. The AutoCapture window looks like this (as of version 2.0)
    <br><br>
    <div align="center">
    <img src="images/autocapture.jpg" border="2" alt="Autocapture" />
    </div>
    <br>
    As you can see, some general instructions are present in the window just in case you forget.
    To enter your desired time interval, you can enter a value in the &quot;Take screenshots
    automaticall every&quot; textbox. Valid values are 1 to 60 when seconds are selected, and 250
    to 60000 when milliseconds are selected. You can also choose if you want to take screenshots
    of all windows or just the active window. Please note that the file format, image quality (if it applies),
    and output folder values will be taken from the options window. So if you want to autocapture to a different
    folder, change it in the <a href="options.htm">options</a> first.
    <br>
    <br>
    Clicking on &quot;Start Autocapture&quot; will minimize the window and proceed to take screenshots
    at the specified intervals. If at any moment you wish to stop, just click on the &quot;AutoCapture&quot; taskbar 
    entry to bring the AutoCapture window up again. Then you can click on &quot;Stop AutoCapture&quot; button
    to stop the interval. The taskbar entry will look like this:
    <br><br>
    <div align="center">
        <img src="images/autocapture_min.jpg" border="2">
    </div>
    <br>
    After clicking on the taskbar entry, the window will restore itself and look like this:
      <br><br>
    <div align="center">
        <img src="images/autocapture_stop.jpg" border="2">
    </div>
    <br>  
    Now it's just a matter of clicking on &quot;Stop AutoCapture&quot; and we're done.
