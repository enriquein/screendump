    <div class="subheading">How to take a Screenshot</div>
    You take screenshots by pressing the "Print Screen" key on your keyboard.
    If you can't find it, it's located near the F12 and Scroll Lock keys.
    <br /><br />
    Hitting the Print Screen key will save an image of all the current windows
    now showing on your screen (without the mouse pointer). Hitting Alt+Print
    Screen will save an image of the active window only.
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="subheading">Menu Overview</div>
    Before we discuss the menu, note that it will only pop up when
    you Right-Click the icon in the System Tray. Here's a screenshot
    of what the menu looks like as of version 2.1
    <div align="center">
