    <div class="subheading">How to take a Screenshot</div>
    You take screenshots by pressing the "Print Screen" key on your keyboard.
    If you can't find it, it's located near the F12 and Scroll Lock keys.
    <br /><br />
    Hitting the Print Screen key will save an image of all the current windows
    now showing on your screen (without the mouse pointer). Hitting Alt+Print
    Screen will save an image of the active window only.
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="subheading">Menu Overview</div>
    Before we discuss the menu, note that it will only pop up when
    you Right-Click the icon in the System Tray. Here's a screenshot
    of what the menu looks like as of version 2.2
    <div align="center">
    <br />
    <img src="images/icon_plain.jpg" border="2" alt="Icon Only">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   
    <img src="images/icon_menu.jpg" border="2" alt="Icon and Menu Screenshot">
    </div>
    <br />
    Now let's discuss what each option does.
    <br><br>
    <div class="subheading">Open Screenshots Folder</div>
    Clicking on this will open the folder which you have designated for saving screenshots.
    If you haven't configured it, the default is the program's folder.
    <br><br>
    <div class="subheading">AutoCapture</div>
    Opens the window to configure automatic capture of screenshots. For more details
    check the topic on <a href="autocapture.htm">AutoCapture</a>.
    <br><br>    
    <div class="subheading">Options</div>
    Opens the options window. Here you can configure image format, output folder, and wether
    to take screenshots of video/movie windows. For more details check the topic on 
    <a href="options.htm">Options</a>.
    <br><br>
    <div class="subheading">Empty Clipboard</div>
    If you selected the option to store screenshot data on the clipboard, you can click on this menu item
    to remove that data from memory. Note that this will work with any data stored on the clipboard, even by other
    programs. This allows for clipboard cleanup when other programs don't clean up after themselves.
    <br><br>
    <div class="subheading">Help</div>
    Launches the help manual. 
    <br><br>
    <div class="subheading">About...</div>
    Opens an window with information about the program, the current version, support information, and other miscelaneous information.
    <br><br>
    <div class="subheading">Still Lost?</div>
    If you're still lost, please go ahead and read the FAQ. If after that you still
    need further assistance, feel free to send me an email or post a question in the project's launchpad site. 
    All the information you need is in the contact info area.
