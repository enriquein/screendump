        Known Issues and limitations
    </div>
    <hr>
    <br>
        When the "Take screenshots of video windows" option is enabled
        <b>and</b> you have a multi monitor configuration (meaning that 
        you use your computer with 2 or more monitors/displays at the same time),
        you may experience some issues. Now, I haven't tested this feature since around
        2004, because I don't have a multi monitor setup I can test on (sadly). Maybe the issues were
        caused by old drivers, maybe old hardware. If you experience issues just disable this 
        option or enable it only when necessary. Read on.
        <br><br>
        When using "Clone Mode", the secondary display may flicker for a 
        second when bScreenDumped starts. This has been known to vary depending
        on the video card you're using (on some cards the screen may go black/dark blue).
         Most of the times, this can be fixed by
        readjusting the display resolution, or running a video. This <b>ONLY</b> happens
        when you have the "Take screenshots of video windows" option set. 
        <br><br>
        When "Expanding" your desktop across multiple displays, the program is only
        able to take screenshots of videos within the primary display. If you try to
        take a screenshot of a video that's on another display, you will get an empty
        black box where the video is supposed to be (the same behavior as when having the
        option set to off).
        <br><br>
        As I don't have the ability to test a multiple display set up at the moment, please
        report your experiences by email or through our bugtracker. Hopefully we'll iron this out.
        And just in case it wasn't clear the first time, these issues <b>ONLY</b> apply when you 
        have the "Take screenshots of video windows" option set.
