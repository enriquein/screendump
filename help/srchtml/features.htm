<ul>
    <li>Save screenshots to disk as soon as you hit the
        (Alt) PrintScreen key. No need to paste on an image
        editor and then save!</li>
    <li>Option to either let the program Automatically
        generate filenames or assign your own.</li>
    <li>Support for taking screenshots of videos/movies/overlays/webcam sessions, etc.</li>
    <li>Can take 3-12 screenshots per second if hit
        repeatedly (your finger speed is the limit).</li>
    <li>Supports taking automatic screenshots in specified intervals.
        For example, you can have it take screenshots automatically every second,
        or every half second, etc. Intervals can be set from 250ms to 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Allows saving to BMP, PNG, or JPG format (JPG quality
        can be adjusted).</li>
    <li>Supports saving settings to the user's profile so multiple
        users can use the program while each having its own
        settings.</li>
    <!-- <li>Since version 2.3 it can be configured to be used portably (as in, save it to your usb flash disk
        and run it from anywhere without having to install). -->
    <li><a href="knownissues.htm">Support</a> for multiple displays*.</li>
    <li>Tested to run correctly on Windows 2000, XP, 2003 Server, Vista, 2008 Server. It seems that a recent change in Visual Studio makes it impossible to target versions before Windows 2000. If I get enough requests I might consider making a special build for Windows 9x users.</li>
    <li>This program is free, open source software. It has no Malware, Trojans, Ad-Ware, etc., and you can
        freely get the source and verify this for yourself.</li>
</ul>
