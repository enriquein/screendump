    screendump is a simple program I made when I figured
    most other screenshot-taking programs I've tried are
    either overbloated with features I don't want/need
    or just don't cut it. So I basically made this as
    simple-but-functional as I could possibly want it to be.
    <br> <br>
    Just hit the Print Screen Key (or Alt+Print Screen for
    active window) and the screenshot is automatically
    saved to the hard disk. If you hit it fast enough you
    might get 3-12 screenshots each second*, not bad.
