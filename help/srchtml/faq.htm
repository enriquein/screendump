    <div class="answer">
        This program doesn't have much of an user interface
        other than the system tray icon. Look for the program's icon near the clock thingie on the bottom
        right corner of your screen.

    <div class="questionheading">Question:</div>
    <div class="question">When I run the program I get the following error: "Runtime error 48. File not found: gdiplus". What happened?</div>
    <div class="answerheading">Answer:</div>
    <div class="answer">    
        Don't panic. This just means that the program can't find the GDI+ Dll. To fix
        this, download and install the Non-WindowsXP version of screendump found in the downloads area.
        Remember to uninstall any previous versions before reinstalling. Also remember that if you intend to
        run screendump from a usb flash drive (or any other kind of removable media) 
        you should get the portable version installer instead. (Portable version of the installer is not available yet.
        It's planned for the 2.3 release).

    <div class="question">A new version of screendump came out. Do I just install it over the old one?</div>
    <div class="answerheading">Answer:</div> 
    <div class="answer">
        No. This is a bad idea. Please uninstall the previous version before installing
        the new one. Also remember to exit the program before attempting the uninstall.
