
screendump Changes by Version. 
  _____
 / 2.3 \
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| screendump 2.3; Released on July/28/2009
|
| + Fixed Alt+PrintScreen bug that made screenshots sometime contain garbage
|   or solid color where the window border was supposed to be. This bug only
|   happened under Windows Vista or Windows 7, and when Aero was enabled.

  _________
 / 2.2.0.1 \
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| screendump 2.2.0.1; Released on July/18/2009
|
| + screendump now supports native 64 bit Windows. The installer should 
|   be able to determine the right version for your operating system.

  _____
 / 2.2 \
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| screendump 2.2; Released on Dec/7/2008
|
|  + screendump is the open source continuation of bScreenDumped2. The project was
|    renamed to (hopefully) avoid confusion between the two versions.
|
|  + Changed the naming scheme on files to a shorter one. A future release will
|    make generated filenames be editable by the user (as a pattern).
|
|  + Application icons were changed.
|
|  + Added support for clipboard use (which is now optional, as opposed to 2.1 
|    where the clipboard functionality was disabled).
|
|  + Code optimizations were done throughout the program. 
|
|  + Fixed the bug where in some cases the program would leave an item in the 
|    taskbar on launch.
|
|  + Added support for running across multiple sessions. What this means is that
|    if you're using a Windows Server version that supports having multiple users
|    logged at the same time, while working on separate sessions, now the program
|    can run and not throw an error about "being already running". Of course, the
|    program is still smart enough to know when the user is trying to run a second
|    instance of the program in the same session.
|
|  + Enabling screenshots of videos no longer requires a program restart.
|
|  + Added UNICODE support.
|
|  + Added a proper help manual.

  _____
 / 2.1 \
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| screendump 2.1; Released on June/18/2005
|
|  + Fixed an initialization screwup. I forgot to set
|    the OSVERSION size correctly, so the program almost
|    never knew which version of Windows it was running on.
|    This domino effected into the program not reading its 
|    settings, and other misc side effects.
|
|  + Added: AutoCapture Dialog. This dialog takes care of the AutoCapture feature.
|    This allows the user to set a interval at which the program will automatically
|    take screenshots.For now it's a bit limited, I'll add more features at a
|    later time.

  _____
 / 2.0 \
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| screendump 2.0; Released on May/20/2005 
|
|  + Added support for PNG format. 
|
|  + Added ability to take screenshots of Videos/Movies.
|
|  + Completely rewrote the program in Visual C++ 7 (no more need of VB Runtimes).
|
|  + Added support to take screenshots on multiple displays (2+ monitors).

  _____
 / 1.0 \
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| screendump 1.0; Released on Feb/21/05 
|
|  + Minor code changes. Speedups that might be too slight to be even noticed. 
|
|  + Fixed issue with the 'Save As...' dialogue not saving the files.
|
|  + Fixed issue with settings not being saved under some circumstances.
|
|  + Program will use the User's Profile Path under Windows NT-based systems.
|
|  + Adjusted 'About' window to have the thanks section.
|
|  + Rearanged Systray Menu.
|
|  + Declared stable enough to be the 1.0 release.

  _____
 / 0.7 \
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| screendump 0.7; Released on Jan/10/05 
|
|  + Fixed some minor issues with the 'Save File Dialogue' when not
|    using automatic filenames.
|
|  + Automatic filenames now include the milliseconds. This prevents the
|    screenshots from being overwritten when taking consecutive screenshots.
|    This made it look like the program had lag while dumping the images, since
|    most files were overwritten up to 2-3 times.
|
|  + Pushed down the delay for retry capture to 100 milliseconds. After 120-200
|    consecutive screenshots it still only needed to retry once!
|
|  + Also pushed down the retry delay for the System Tray Icon. This will probably
|    make it look like it loaded faster.

  _____
 / 0.6 \
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| screendump 0.6; Released on Dec/16/04 
|
|  + Added a definite workaround for the Shell_IconInitialize procedure. Now the
|    System Tray Icon will always appear.

  _____
 / 0.5 \
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| screendump 0.5; Released on Nov/26/04 
|
|  + Added a check for when the gdiplus.dll didn't initialize properly. Now if for
|    some reason the dll doesn't load, you can still use the program and dump 
|    bmp's. Note though, that if you don't have gdiplus.dll on your system, the
|    program will exit with an error: 'Cannot find file gdiplus.'
|
|  + Tested the program on Windows 95. The JPEG's look kinda funny (they seem to
|    ignore the encoder's 'Quality' value), but the program works like a charm.

  _____
 / 0.4 \
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| screendump 0.4; Released on Nov/22/04 
|
|  + Added option to save screenshots as jpg's.
| 
|  + Added another workaround for the "Failed to create shell icon" error.

  _____
 / 0.3 \
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| screendump 0.3; Released on Oct/23/04 
|
|  + Added preliminary bugfix for an Initialization error "Failed to create 
|    shell icon".  
  
  _____
 / 0.2 \
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| screendump 0.2; Released on Oct/06/04 
|
|  + Fixed an issue where the System Tray Icon Menu wouldn't dissapear after 
|    clicking outside the menu area.  
| 
|  + Added feature to name files manually after hitting the PrintScreen key.
|
|  + Changed the "Browse for folder" window to the Windows Common Dialog one.
|
|  + Changed the About Window. 
|
|  + Added Menu Item to open the selected destination folder. If no folder was 
|    specified then it tries to open either the last one used to save a 
|    screenshot or the program's folder.
|
|  + Fixed a _really_ nasty bug where the program would continously give an error
|    registering the hotkeys but would never quit. A stack overflow error would
|    then occur and all hell broke loose. Also realized that by design, no 2 
|    programs can be intercepting the same keys as hotkeys.
|
|  + Fixed a bug where the program would accidentally prevent Windows from 
|    shutting down.

  _____
 / 0.1 \
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| screendump 0.1; Released on Oct/02/04 - Initial Release.
